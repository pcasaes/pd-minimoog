A Pure Data synthesizer based on the minimoog.
http://gitorious.org/pd-minimoog

To install make sure that the contents of pd-minimoog are in PD's pad.

Should look like something like this:

...pd path/minimoog-help.pd
...pd path/minimoog.pd
...pd path/moog
...pd path/singleton

You also must install muug~ onto PD's path. 
You can acquire it here:
